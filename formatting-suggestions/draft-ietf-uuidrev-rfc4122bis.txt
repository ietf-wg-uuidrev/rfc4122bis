          A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace
                  draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
   UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers), also known as GUIDs (Globally
   Unique IDentifiers).  A UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee
   uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs were originally used in the
   Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open Software
   Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then
   in Microsoft Windows platforms.

   This specification is derived from the DCE specification with the
   kind permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group).
   Information from earlier versions of the DCE specification have been
   incorporated into this document.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
   UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifiers), also known as GUIDs (Globally
   Unique IDentifiers).  A UUID is 128 bits long, and requires no
   central registration process.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to implement services using UUIDs as URNs [RFC8141].  Nothing in this
   document should be construed to override the DCE standards that
   defined UUIDs.

   There is an ITU-T Recommendation and an ISO/IEC Standard [X667] that
   are derived from [RFC4122].  Both sets of specifications have been
   aligned and are fully technically compatible.  In addition, a global
   registration function is being provided by the Telecommunications
   Standardization Bureau of ITU-T; for details see
   https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/UUID/uuids.aspx.

2.  Motivation

   One of the main reasons for using UUIDs is that no centralized
   authority is required to administer them (although one format uses
   IEEE 802 node identifiers, others do not).  As a result, generation
   on demand can be completely automated, and used for a variety of
   purposes.  The UUID generation algorithm described here supports very
   high allocation rates of up to 10 million per second per machine if
   necessary, so that they could even be used as transaction IDs.

   UUIDs are of a fixed size (128 bits), which is reasonably small
   compared to other alternatives.  This lends itself well to sorting,
   ordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple
   allocation, and ease of programming in general.

   Since UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform
   Resource Names.  The unique ability to generate a new UUID without a
   registration process allows for UUIDs to be one of the URNs with the
   lowest minting cost.

2.1.  Update motivation

   Many things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally
   created.  Modern applications have a need to create and utilize UUIDs
   as the primary identifier for a variety of different items in complex
   computational systems, including but not limited to database keys,
   file names, machine or system names, and identifiers for event-driven
   transactions.

   One area in which UUIDs have gained popularity is as database keys.
   This stems from the increasingly distributed nature of modern
   applications.  In such cases, "auto increment" schemes often used by
   databases do not work well, as the effort required to coordinate
   sequential numeric identifiers across a network can easily become a
   burden.  The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique, reasonably
   short values in distributed systems without requiring coordination
   makes them a good alternative, but UUID versions 1-5 lack certain
   other desirable characteristics:

   1.  Non-time-ordered UUID versions such as UUIDv4 (described in
       Section 5.4) have poor database index locality.  This means that
       new values created in succession are not close to each other in
       the index and thus require inserts to be performed at random
       locations.  The negative performance effects of which on common
       structures used for this (B-tree and its variants) can be
       dramatic.

   2.  The 100-nanosecond Gregorian epoch used in UUIDv1 (described in
       Section 5.1) timestamps is uncommon and difficult to represent
       accurately using a standard number format such as [IEEE754].

   3.  Introspection/parsing is required to order by time sequence, as
       opposed to being able to perform a simple byte-by-byte
       comparison.

   4.  Privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
       address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC
       addresses can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and
       reveal various other information about such machines (minimally
       manufacturer, potentially other details).  Additionally, with the
       advent of virtual machines and containers, MAC address uniqueness
       is no longer guaranteed.

   5.  Many of the implementation details specified in RFC4122 involved
       trade offs that are neither possible to specify for all
       applications nor necessary to produce interoperable
       implementations.

   6.  RFC4122 did not distinguish between the requirements for
       generation of a UUID versus an application that simply stores
       one, which are often different.

   Due to the aforementioned issues, many widely distributed database
   applications and large application vendors have sought to solve the
   problem of creating a better time-based, sortable unique identifier
   for use as a database key.  This has lead to numerous implementations
   over the past 10+ years solving the same problem in slightly
   different ways.

   While preparing this specification, the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing:

   1.   [ULID] by A.  Feerasta
   2.   [LexicalUUID] by Twitter
   3.   [Snowflake] by Twitter
   4.   [Flake] by Boundary
   5.   [ShardingID] by Instagram
   6.   [KSUID] by Segment
   7.   [Elasticflake] by P.  Pearcy
   8.   [FlakeID] by T.  Pawlak
   9.   [Sonyflake] by Sony
   10.  [orderedUuid] by IT.  Cabrera
   11.  [COMBGUID] by R.  Tallent
   12.  [SID] by A.  Chilton

   14.  [XID] by O.  Poitrey
   15.  [ObjectID] by MongoDB
   16.  [CUID] by E.  Elliott

   An inspection of these implementations and the issues described above
   has led to this document which attempts to adapt UUIDs to address
   these issues.

4.  UUID Format

   The UUID format is 16 octets (128 bits); the variant bits in
   conjunction with the version bits described in the next sections in
   determine finer structure.  While discussing UUID formats and layout,
   bit definitions start at 0 and end at 127 while octet definitions
   start at 0 and end at 15.

   UUIDs MAY be represented as binary data or integers.  When in use
   with URNs or applications, any given UUID SHOULD be represented by
   the "hex-and-dash" string format consisting of multiple groups of
   upper or lowercase alphanumeric hex characters separated by single
   dashes/hyphens.  When used with databases please refer to
   Section 6.12.

   The formal definition of the UUID string representation is provided
   by the following (ABNF) [RFC5234].

      UUID     = 4hexOctet "-"
                 2hexOctet "-"
                 2hexOctet "-"
                 2hexOctet "-"
                 6hexOctet
      hexOctet = HEXDIG HEXDIG
      DIGIT    = %x30-39
      HEXDIG   = DIGIT / "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   An example UUID using this textual representation from the above ABNF
   is shown in Figure 1.  Note that in this example the alphabetic
   characters may be all uppercase, all lowercase or mixed case as per
   [RFC5234], Section 2.3

   f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

                    Figure 1: Example String UUID format

   The same UUID from Figure 1 is represented in Binary Figure 2,
   Integer Figure 3 and as a URN Figure 4 defined by [RFC8141].

4.1.  Variant Field

   The variant field determines the layout of the UUID.  That is, the
   interpretation of all other bits in the UUID depends on the setting
   of the bits in the variant field.  As such, it could more accurately
   be called a type field; we retain the original term for
   compatibility.  The variant field consists of a variable number of
   the most significant bits of octet 8 of the UUID.

   Table 1 lists the contents of the variant field, where the letter "x"
   indicates a "don't-care" value.

                           Table 1: UUID Variants

   Interoperability, in any form, with variants other than the one
   defined here is not guaranteed but is not likely to be an issue in
   practice.

   Specifically for UUIDs in this document bits 64 and 65 of the UUID
   (bits 0 and 1 of octet 8) MUST be set to 1 and 0 as specified in row
   2 of Table 1.  Accordingly, all bit and field layouts avoid the use
   of these bits.

4.2.  Version Field

   The version number is in the most significant 4 bits of octet 6 (bits
   48 through 51 of the UUID).

   Table 2 lists all of the versions for this UUID variant specified in
   this document.

5.  UUID Layouts

   To minimize confusion about bit assignments within octets and among
   differing versions, the UUID record definition is defined only in
   terms of fields that are integral numbers of octets.  The fields are
   presented with the most significant one first.

   In the absence of explicit application or presentation protocol
   specification to the contrary, each field is encoded with the Most
   Significant Byte first (known as network byte order).

5.1.  UUID Version 1

   UUID Version 1 is a time-based UUID featuring a 60-bit timestamp
   represented by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-
   nanosecond intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582 (the date of
   Gregorian reform to the Christian calendar).

   UUID Version 1 also features a clock sequence field which is used to
   help avoid duplicates that could arise when the clock is set
   backwards in time or if the node ID changes.

   The node field consists of an IEEE 802 MAC address, usually the host
   address.  For systems with multiple IEEE 802 addresses, any available
   one MAY be used.  The lowest addressed octet (octet number 10)
   contains the global/local bit and the unicast/multicast bit, and is
   the first octet of the address transmitted on an 802.3 LAN.

                   Figure 6: UUIDv1 Field and Bit Layout

   time_low:
      The least significant 32 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3)

   time_mid:
      The middle 16 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 32 through 47 (octets 4-5)

   ver:
      The 4 bit version field as defined by Section 4.2 set to 0001.
      Occupies bits 48 through 51 of octet 6.

   time_high:
      12 bits that will contain the most significant 12 bits from the 60
      bit starting timestamp.  Occupies bits 52 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   var:
      The 2 bit variant field as defined by Section 4.1 set to 10.
      Occupies bits 64 and 65 of octet 8.

   clock_seq:
      The 14-bits containing the clock sequence.  Occupies bits 66
      through 79 (octets 8-9).

   node:
      48 bit spatially unique identifier Occupies bits 80 through 127
      (octets 10-15)

   For systems that do not have UTC available, but do have the local
   time, they may use that instead of UTC, as long as they do so
   consistently throughout the system.  However, this is not recommended
   since generating the UTC from local time only needs a time zone
   offset.

   If the clock is set backwards, or might have been set backwards
   (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the UUID generator can
   not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than
   the value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence MUST be
   changed.  If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it
   MAY be incremented; otherwise it SHOULD be set to a random or high-
   quality pseudo-random value.

   Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g., because a network card has
   been moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random
   number minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight
   differences in the clock settings of the machines.  If the value of
   clock sequence associated with the changed node ID were known, then
   the clock sequence MAY be incremented, but that is unlikely.

   The clock sequence MUST be originally (i.e., once in the lifetime of
   a system) initialized to a random number to minimize the correlation
   across systems.  This provides maximum protection against node
   identifiers that may move or switch from system to system rapidly.
   The initial value MUST NOT be correlated to the node identifier.

   For systems with no IEEE address, a randomly or pseudo-randomly
   generated value may be used; see Section 6.8 and Section 6.9.

5.2.  UUID Version 2

   UUID Version 2 is known as DCE Security UUIDs [C309] and [C311].  As
   such the definition of these UUIDs are outside the scope of this
   specification.

5.3.  UUID Version 3

   UUID Version 3 is meant for generating UUIDs from "names" that are
   drawn from, and unique within, some "name space" as per Section 6.5.

   UUIDv3 values are created by computing an MD5 [RFC1321] hash over a
   given name space value concatenated with the desired name value after
   both have been converted to a canonical sequence of octets in network
   byte order.  This MD5 value is then used to populate all 128 bits of
   the UUID layout.  The UUID version and variant then replace the
   respective bits as defined by Section 4.2 and Section 4.1.

   Some common name space values have been defined via Appendix A.

   Where possible UUIDv5 SHOULD be used in lieu of UUIDv3.  For more
   information on MD5 security considerations see [RFC6151].

      The final 62 bits of the layout immediately following the var
      field to be filled with the least-significant, right-most bits of
      the final 64 bits from the computed MD5 value.

5.4.  UUID Version 4

   The version 4 UUID is meant for generating UUIDs from truly-random or
   pseudo-random numbers.

   An implementation may generate 128 bits of random random data which
   is used to fill out the UUID fields in Figure 8.  The UUID version
   and variant then replace the respective bits as defined by
   Section 4.2 and Section 4.1,

   Alternatively, an implementation MAY choose to randomly generate the
   exact required number of bits for for random_a, random_b, and
   random_c then concatenate the version and variant in the required
   position.

   For guidelines on random data generation see Section 6.8.

   random_c:
      The final 62 bits of the layout immediately following the var
      field to be filled with random data as per Section 6.8

5.5.  UUID Version 5

   UUID Version 5 is meant for generating UUIDs from "names" that are
   drawn from, and unique within, some "name space" as per Section 6.5.

   UUIDv5 values are created by computing an SHA1 [SHA1] hash over a
   given name space value concatenated with the desired name value after
   both have been converted to a canonical sequence of octets in network
   byte order.  This SHA1 value is then used to populate all 128 bits of
   the UUID layout.  Excess bits beyond 128 are discarded.  The UUID
   version and variant then replace the respective bits as defined by
   Section 4.2 and Section 4.1

   Some common name space values have been defined via Appendix A.

   There may be scenarios, usually depending on organizational security
   policies, where SHA1 libraries may not be available or deemed unsafe
   for use.  As such it may be desirable to generate name-based UUIDs
   derived from SHA256 or newer SHA methods.  These name-based UUIDs
   MUST NOT utilize UUIDv5 and MUST be within the UUIDv8 space defined
   by Section 5.8.  For implementation guidance around utilizing UUIDv8
   for name-based UUIDs refer to the sub-section of Section 6.5.

   For more information on SHA1 security considerations see [RFC6194].

      bits of the remaining SHA1 hash and then using the next 62 most
      significant, left-most bits.  Any leftover SHA1 bits are discarded
      and unused.

5.6.  UUID Version 6

   UUID version 6 is a field-compatible version of UUIDv1, reordered for
   improved DB locality.  It is expected that UUIDv6 will primarily be
   used in contexts where there are existing v1 UUIDs.  Systems that do
   not involve legacy UUIDv1 SHOULD use UUIDv7 instead.

   Instead of splitting the timestamp into the low, mid and high
   sections from UUIDv1, UUIDv6 changes this sequence so timestamp bytes
   are stored from most to least significant.  That is, given a 60 bit
   timestamp value as specified for UUIDv1 in Section 5.1, for UUIDv6,
   the first 48 most significant bits are stored first, followed by the
   4 bit version (same position), followed by the remaining 12 bits of
   the original 60 bit timestamp.

   The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from their usage and
   position in Section 5.1.

   The clock sequence and node bits SHOULD be reset to a pseudo-random
   value for each new UUIDv6 generated; however, implementations MAY
   choose to retain the old MAC address behavior from Section 5.1.  For
   more information on MAC address usage within UUIDs see the Section 9.

   The format for the 16-byte, 128 bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 10

   time_high:
      The most significant 32 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3)

      The middle 16 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 32 through 47 (octets 4-5)

   ver:

      Occupies bits 48 through 51 of Octet 6.

   time_low:

      60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies bits 52 through 63 (octets
      6-7)

   node:
      48 bit spatially unique identifier Occupies bits 80 through 127
      (octets 10-15)

   With UUIDv6 the steps for splitting the timestamp into time_high and
   time_mid are OPTIONAL since the 48 bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order.  An extra step of splitting the first
   48 bits of the timestamp into the most significant 32 bits and least
   significant 16 bits proves useful when reusing an existing UUIDv1
   implementation.

5.7.  UUID Version 7

   UUID version 7 features a time-ordered value field derived from the
   widely implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source, the
   number of milliseconds seconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970 UTC, leap
   seconds excluded.  UUID verion 7 also has improved entropy
   characteristics over versions 1 or 6.

   Implementations SHOULD utilize UUID version 7 instead of UUID version
   1 and 6 if possible.

5.8.  UUID Version 8

   UUID version 8 provides an RFC-compatible format for experimental or
   vendor-specific use cases.  The only requirement is that the variant
   and version bits MUST be set as defined in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2.  UUIDv8's uniqueness will be implementation-specific and
   MUST NOT be assumed.

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific UUIDs.  To be clear: UUIDv8 is
   not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are filled with
   random data.

   Some example situations in which UUIDv8 usage could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the use of one of the current UUIDs.

6.  UUID Best Practices

   The minimum requirements for generating UUIDs are described in this
   document for each version.  Everything else is an implementation
   detail and up to the implementer to decide what is appropriate for a
   given implementation.  Various relevant factors are covered below to
   help guide an implementer through the different trade-offs among
   differing UUID implementations.

6.1.  Timestamp Considerations

   UUID timestamp source, precision and length was the topic of great
   debate while creating UUIDv7 for this specification.  Choosing the
   right timestamp for your application is a very important topic.  This
   section will detail some of the most common points on this topic.

   Reliability:
      Implementations SHOULD use the current timestamp from a reliable
      source to provide values that are time-ordered and continually
      increasing.  Care SHOULD be taken to ensure that timestamp changes
      from the environment or operating system are handled in a way that
      is consistent with implementation requirements.  For example, if
      it is possible for the system clock to move backward due to either
      manual adjustment or corrections from a time synchronization
      protocol, implementations need to determine how to handle such
      cases.  (See Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing bullet below.)

   Source:
      UUID version 1 and 6 both utilize a Gregorian epoch timestamp
      while UUIDv7 utilizes a Unix Epoch timestamp.  If other timestamp
      sources or a custom timestamp epoch are required UUIDv8 SHOULD be
      used.

   Sub-second Precision and Accuracy:
      Many levels of precision exist for timestamps: milliseconds,
      microseconds, nanoseconds, and beyond.  Additionally fractional
      representations of sub-second precision may be desired to mix
      various levels of precision in a time-ordered manner.
      Furthermore, system clocks themselves have an underlying
      granularity and it is frequently less than the precision offered
      by the operating system.  With UUID version 1 and 6,
      100-nanoseconds of precision are present while UUIDv7 features
      fixed millisecond level of precision within the Unix epoch that
      does not exceed the granularity capable in most modern systems.
      For other levels of precision UUIDv8 SHOULD be utilized.  Similar
      to Section 6.2, with UUIDv1 or UUIDv6, a high resolution timestamp
      can be simulated by keeping a count of the number of UUIDs that
      have been generated with the same value of the system time, and
      using it to construct the low order bits of the timestamp.  The
      count will range between zero and the number of 100-nanosecond
      intervals per system time interval.

   Length:
      The length of a given timestamp directly impacts how long a given
      UUID will be valid.  That is, how many timestamp ticks can be
      contained in a UUID before the maximum value for the timestamp
      field is reached.  Care SHOULD be given to ensure that the proper
      length is selected for a given timestamp.  UUID version 1 and 6
      utilize a 60 bit timestamp valid until 5623 AD and UUIDv7 features
      a 48 bit timestamp valid until the year 10889 AD.

   Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing:
      Implementations MAY alter the actual timestamp.  Some examples
      include security considerations around providing a real clock
      value within a UUID, to correct inaccurate clocks, or to handle
      leap seconds.  This specification makes no requirement or
      guarantee about how close the clock value needs to be to the
      actual time.  If UUIDs do not need to be frequently generated, the
      UUIDv1 or UUIDv6 timestamp can simply be the system time
      multiplied by the number of 100-nanosecond intervals per system
      time interval.

   Padding:
      When timestamp padding is required, implementations MUST pad the
      most significant bits (left-most) bits with zeros.  An example is
      padding the most significant, left-most bits of a 32 bit Unix
      timestamp with zeros to fill out the 48 bit timestamp in UUIDv7.

   Truncating:
      When timestamps need to be truncated, the lower, least significant
      bits MUST be used.  An example would be truncating a 64 bit Unix
      timestamp to the least significant, right-most 48 bits for UUIDv7.

   Error Handling:
      If a system overruns the generator by requesting too many UUIDs
      within a single system time interval, the UUID service MUST either
      return an error, or stall the UUID generator until the system
      clock catches up.  Note that if the processors overrun the UUID
      generation frequently, additional node identifiers can be
      allocated to the system, which will permit higher speed allocation
      by making multiple UUIDs potentially available for each time stamp
      value.  Similar techniques are discussed in Section 6.4.

6.2.  Monotonicity and Counters

   Monotonicity is the backbone of time-based sortable UUIDs.  Normally,
   time-based UUIDs from this document will be monotonic due to an
   embedded timestamp; however, implementations can guarantee additional
   monotonicity via the concepts covered in this section.

   Care SHOULD be taken to ensure UUIDs generated in batches are also
   monotonic.  That is, if one thousand UUIDs are generated for the same
   timestamp, there SHOULD be sufficient logic for organizing the
   creation order of those one thousand UUIDs.  Batch UUID creation
   implementations MAY utilize a monotonic counter that SHOULD increment
   for each UUID created during a given timestamp.

   For single-node UUID implementations that do not need to create
   batches of UUIDs, the embedded timestamp within UUID version 6 and 7
   can provide sufficient monotonicity guarantees by simply ensuring
   that timestamp increments before creating a new UUID.  Distributed
   nodes are discussed in Section 6.4.

   Implementations SHOULD choose one method for single-node UUID
   implementations that require batch UUID creation.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Bits (Method 1):
      Some implementations allocate a specific number of bits in the
      UUID layout to the sole purpose of tallying the total number of
      UUIDs created during a given UUID timestamp tick.  A fixed bit-
      length counter, if present, SHOULD be positioned immediately after
      the embedded timestamp.  This promotes sortability and allows
      random data generation for each counter increment.  With this
      method, the rand_a section of UUIDv7 SHOULD be used as fixed-
      length dedicated counter bits that are incremented by one for
      every UUID generation.  The trailing random bits generated for
      each new UUID in rand_b can help produce unguessable UUIDs.  In
      the event more counter bits are required, the most significant
      (left-most) bits of rand_b MAY be used as additional counter bits.

   Monotonic Random (Method 2):
      With this method, the random data is extended to also function as
      a counter.  This monotonic value can be thought of as a "randomly
      seeded counter" which MUST be incremented in the least significant
      position for each UUID created on a given timestamp tick.
      UUIDv7's rand_b section SHOULD be utilized with this method to
      handle batch UUID generation during a single timestamp tick.  The
      increment value for every UUID generation SHOULD be a random
      integer of any desired length larger than zero.  It ensures the
      UUIDs retain the required level of unguessability provided by the
      underlying entropy.  The increment value MAY be one when the
      number of UUIDs generated in a particular period of time is
      important and guessability is not an issue.  However, it SHOULD
      NOT be used by implementations that favor unguessiblity, as the
      resulting values are easily guessable.

   The following sub-topics cover topics related solely with creating
   reliable fixed-length dedicated counters:

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding:
      Implementations utilizing the fixed-length counter method SHOULD
      randomly initialize the counter with each new timestamp tick.
      However, when the timestamp has not incremented, the counter
      SHOULD be frozen and incremented via the desired increment logic.
      When utilizing a randomly seeded counter alongside Method 1, the
      random value MAY be regenerated with each counter increment
      without impacting sortability.  The downside is that Method 1 is
      prone to overflows if a counter of adequate length is not selected
      or the random data generated leaves little room for the required
      number of increments.  Implementations utilizing fixed-length
      counter method MAY also choose to randomly initialize a portion
      counter rather than the entire counter.  For example, a 24 bit
      counter could have the 23 bits in least-significant, right-most,
      position randomly initialized.  The remaining most significant,
      left-most counter bits are initialized as zero for the sole
      purpose of guarding against counter rollovers.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Length:
      Care MUST be taken to select a counter bit-length that can
      properly handle the level of timestamp precision in use.  For
      example, millisecond precision generally requires a larger counter
      than a timestamp with nanosecond precision.  General guidance is
      that the counter SHOULD be at least 12 bits but no longer than 42
      bits.  Care SHOULD also be given to ensure that the counter length
      selected leaves room for sufficient entropy in the random portion
      of the UUID after the counter.  This entropy helps improve the
      unguessability characteristics of UUIDs created within the batch.

   The following sub-topics cover rollover handling with either type of
   counter method:

   Counter Rollover Guards:
      The technique from Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding that
      describes allocating a segment of the fixed-length counter as a
      rollover guard is also helpful to mitigate counter rollover
      issues.  This same technique can be used with monotonic random
      counter methods by ensuring the total length of a possible
      increment in the least significant, right most position is less
      than the total length of the random being incremented.  As such
      the most significant, left-most, bits can be incremented as
      rollover guarding.

   Counter Rollover Handling:
      Counter rollovers SHOULD be handled by the application to avoid
      sorting issues.  The general guidance is that applications that
      care about absolute monotonicity and sortability SHOULD freeze the
      counter and wait for the timestamp to advance which ensures
      monotonicity is not broken.  Alternatively, implementations MAY
      increment the timestamp ahead of the actual time and reinitialize
      the counter.

   Implementations MAY use the following logic to ensure UUIDs featuring
   embedded counters are monotonic in nature:

   1.  Compare the current timestamp against the previously stored
       timestamp.

   2.  If the current timestamp is equal to the previous timestamp,
       increment the counter according to the desired method.

   3.  If the current timestamp is greater than the previous timestamp,
       re-initialize the desired counter method to the new timestamp and
       generate new random bytes (if the bytes were frozen or being used
       as the seed for a monotonic counter).

   Monotonic Error Checking:
      Implementations SHOULD check if the the currently generated UUID
      is greater than the previously generated UUID.  If this is not the
      case then any number of things could have occurred, such as clock
      rollbacks, leap second handling, and counter rollovers.
      Applications SHOULD embed sufficient logic to catch these
      scenarios and correct the problem to ensure that the next UUID
      generated is greater than the previous.  To handle this scenario,
      the general guidance is that application MAY reuse the previous
      timestamp and increment the previous counter method.

6.3.  UUID Generator States

   The UUID generator state only needs to be read from stable storage
   once at boot time, if it is read into a system-wide shared volatile
   store (and updated whenever the stable store is updated).

   This stable storage MAY be used to record various portions of the
   UUID generation which prove useful for batch UUID generation purposes
   and monotonic error checking with UUIDv6 and UUIDv7.  These stored
   values include but are not limited to last known timestamp, clock
   sequence, counters and random data.

   If an implementation does not have any stable store available, then
   it SHOULD proceed with UUID generation as if this was the first UUID
   created within a batch.  This is the least desirable implementation
   because it will increase the frequency of creation of values such as
   clock sequence, counters or random data which increases the
   probability of duplicates.

   An implementation MAY also return an application error in the event
   that collision resistance is of the utmost concern.  The semantics of
   this error are up to the application and implementation.  See
   Section 6.6 for more information on weighting collision tolerance in
   applications.

   For UUIDv1 and UUIDv6, if the node ID can never change (e.g., the
   network interface card from which the node ID is derived is
   inseparable from the system), or if any change also re-initializes
   the clock sequence to a random value, then instead of keeping it in
   stable store, the current node ID may be returned.

   For UUIDv1 and UUIDv6, the state does not always need to be written
   to stable store every time a UUID is generated.  The timestamp in the
   stable store can be periodically set to a value larger than any yet
   used in a UUID.  As long as the generated UUIDs have timestamps less
   than that value, and the clock sequence and node ID remain unchanged,
   only the shared volatile copy of the state needs to be updated.
   Furthermore, if the timestamp value in stable store is in the future
   by less than the typical time it takes the system to reboot, a crash
   will not cause a re-initialization of the clock sequence.

   If it is too expensive to access shared state each time a UUID is
   generated, then the system-wide generator can be implemented to
   allocate a block of time stamps each time it is called; a per-
   process generator can allocate from that block until it is exhausted.

6.4.  Distributed UUID Generation

   Some implementations MAY desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve two or more nodes independently generating
   UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  While UUIDs already
   feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of collision
   are low, as the total number of UUID generating nodes increase; so
   does the likelihood of a collision.

   This section will detail the two additional collision resistance
   approaches that have been observed by by multi-node UUID
   implementations in distributed environments.

   It should be noted that although this section details two methods for
   the sake of completeness; implementations SHOULD utilize the pseudo-
   random Node ID option if additional collision resistance for
   distributed UUID generation is a requirement.  Likewise, utilization
   of either method is not required for implementing UUID generation in
   distributed environments.

   Node IDs:
      With this method, a pseudo-random Node ID value is placed within
      the UUID layout.  This identifier helps ensure the bit-space for a
      given node is unique, resulting in UUIDs that do not conflict with
      any other UUID created by another node with a different node id.
      Implementations that choose to leverage an embedded node id SHOULD
      utilize UUIDv8.  The node id SHOULD NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address
      as per Section 9.  The location and bit length are left to
      implementations and are outside the scope of this specification.
      Furthermore, the creation and negotiation of unique node ids among
      nodes is also out of scope for this specification.

   Centralized Registry:
      With this method all nodes tasked with creating UUIDs consult a
      central registry and confirm the generated value is unique.  As
      applications scale, the communication with the central registry
      could become a bottleneck and impact UUID generation in a negative
      way.  Shared knowledge schemes with central/global registries are
      outside the scope of this specification and is NOT RECOMMENDED.

   Distributed applications generating UUIDs at a variety of hosts MUST
   be willing to rely on the random number source at all hosts.  If this
   is not feasible, the namespace variant should be used.

6.5.  Name-Based UUID Generation

   The concept of name and name space should be broadly construed, and
   not limited to textual names.  For example, some name spaces are the
   domain name system, URLs, Object Identifiers (OIDs), X.500
   Distinguished Names (DNs), and reserved words in a programming
   language.  The mechanisms or conventions used for allocating names
   and ensuring their uniqueness within their name spaces are beyond the
   scope of this specification.

   The requirements for name-based UUIDs are as follows:

   *  UUIDs generated at different times from the same name in the same
      namespace MUST be equal.

   *  UUIDs generated from two different names in the same namespace
      should be different (with very high probability).

   *  UUIDs generated from the same name in two different namespaces
      should be different (with very high probability).

   *  If two UUIDs that were generated from names are equal, then they
      were generated from the same name in the same namespace (with very
      high probability).

   A note on namespaces:
      While Appendix A details a few interesting namespaces;
      implementations SHOULD provide the ability input a custom
      namespace.  For example, any other UUID MAY be generated and uses
      as the desired namespace input for a given application context to
      ensure all names created are unique within the newly created
      namespace.

   Name-based UUIDs using version 8:
      As per Section 5.5 name-based UUIDs that desire to use modern
      hashing algorithms MUST be created within the UUIDv8 space.  These
      MAY leverage newer hashing protocols such as SHA256, SHA512,
      [SHA3] or even protocols that have not been defined yet.  To
      ensure UUIDv8 Name-Based UUID values of different hashing
      protocols can exist in the same bit space; this document defines
      various "hashspaces" in Appendix B.  Creation of name-based
      version 8 UUIDs follow the same logic defined in Section 5.5 but
      the hashspace should be used to as the starting point with the
      desired namespace and name concatenated to the end of the
      hashspace.  Then an implementation may apply the desired hashing
      algorithm to the entire value after all have been converted to a
      canonical sequence of octets in network byte order.  Ensure the
      version and variant and variant bits are modified as per
      Section 5.8 bit layout and finally trim any excess bits beyond
      128.  An important note for secure hashing algorithms that produce
      variable rate outputs, such as those found in SHAKE, the output
      hash MUST be 128 bits or larger.  See Appendix C.8 for a SHA256
      UUIDv8 example test vector.

   Advertising the Hash Algorithm:
      Name-based UUIDs utilizing UUIDv8 do not allocate any available
      bits to identifying the hashing algorithm.  As such where common
      knowledge about the hashing algorithm for a given UUIDv8 name-
      space UUID is required, sharing the Hash Space ID proves useful
      for identifying a the algorithm.  That is, to detail SHA2-256 was
      used to create a given UUIDv8 name-based UUID an implementation
      may also share the "3fb32780-953c-4464-9cfd-e85dbbe9843d" hash
      space which uniquely identifies the SHA2-256 hashing algorithm for
      the purpose of UUIDv8.  Mind you that this need not be the only
      method of sharing the hashing algorithm; this is one example of
      how two systems could share knowledge.  The protocol of choice,
      communication channels and actual method of sharing this data
      between systems it outside the scope of this specification.

6.6.  Collision Resistance

   Implementations SHOULD weigh the consequences of UUID collisions
   within their application and when deciding between UUID versions that
   use entropy (randomness) versus the other components such as those in
   Section 6.1 and Section 6.2.  This is especially true for distributed
   node collision resistance as defined by Section 6.4.

   There are two example scenarios below which help illustrate the
   varying seriousness of a collision within an application.

   Low Impact
      A UUID collision generated a duplicate log entry which results in
      incorrect statistics derived from the data.  Implementations that
      are not negatively affected by collisions may continue with the
      entropy and uniqueness provided by the traditional UUID format.

   High Impact:
      A duplicate key causes an airplane to receive the wrong course
      which puts people's lives at risk.  In this scenario there is no
      margin for error.  Collisions MUST be avoided and failure is
      unacceptable.  Applications dealing with this type of scenario
      MUST employ as much collision resistance as possible within the
      given application context.

6.7.  Global and Local Uniqueness

   UUIDs created by this specification MAY be used to provide local
   uniqueness guarantees.  For example, ensuring UUIDs created within a
   local application context are unique within a database MAY be
   sufficient for some implementations where global uniqueness outside
   of the application context, in other applications, or around the
   world is not required.

   Although true global uniqueness is impossible to guarantee without a
   shared knowledge scheme, a shared knowledge scheme is not required by
   UUID to provide uniqueness guarantees.  Implementations MAY implement
   a shared knowledge scheme introduced in Section 6.4 as they see fit
   to extend the uniqueness guaranteed this specification.

6.8.  Unguessability

   Implementations SHOULD utilize a cryptographically secure pseudo-
   random number generator (CSPRNG) to provide values that are both
   difficult to predict ("unguessable") and have a low likelihood of
   collision ("unique").  Care SHOULD be taken to ensure the CSPRNG
   state is properly reseeded upon state changes, such as process forks,
   to ensure proper CSPRNG operation.  CSPRNG ensures the best of
   Section 6.6 and Section 9 are present in modern UUIDs.

   Further advice on generating cryptographic-quality random numbers can
   be found in [RFC4086] and in [RANDOM].

6.9.  UUIDs that Do Not Identify the Host

   This section describes how to generate a UUIDv1 or UUIDv6 value if an
   IEEE 802 address is not available, or its use is not desired.

   Implementations SHOULD obtain a 47-bit cryptographic-quality random
   number as per Section 6.8 and use it as the low 47 bits of the node
   ID.

   Implementations MUST set the least significant bit of the first octet
   of the node ID set to one to create a 48-bit node id.  This bit is
   the unicast/multicast bit, which will never be set in IEEE 802
   addresses obtained from network cards.  Hence, there can never be a
   conflict between UUIDs generated by machines with and without network
   cards.

   For compatibility with earlier specifications, note that this
   document uses the unicast/multicast bit, instead of the arguably more
   correct local/global bit.

   In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the
   operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help
   differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.

   The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system
   specific, because both the data available and the functions to obtain
   them are often very system specific.  A generic approach, however, is
   to accumulate as many sources as possible into a buffer, use a
   message digest such as MD5 [RFC1321] or SHA-1 [SHA1], take an
   arbitrary 6 bytes from the hash value, and set the multicast bit as
   described above.

6.10.  Sorting

   UUIDv6 and UUIDv7 are designed so that implementations that require
   sorting (e.g. database indexes) SHOULD sort as opaque raw bytes,
   without need for parsing or introspection.

   Time ordered monotonic UUIDs benefit from greater database index
   locality because the new values are near each other in the index.  As
   a result objects are more easily clustered together for better
   performance.  The real-world differences in this approach of index
   locality vs random data inserts can be quite large.

   UUIDs formats created by this specification SHOULD be
   lexicographically sortable while in the textual representation.

   UUIDs created by this specification are crafted with big-endian byte
   order (network byte order) in mind.  If little-endian style is
   required a custom UUID format SHOULD be created using UUIDv8.

6.11.  Opacity

   UUIDs SHOULD be treated as opaque values and implementations SHOULD
   NOT examine the bits in a UUID.  However, inspectors MAY refer to
   Section 4.1 and Section 4.2 when required to determine UUID version
   and variant.

6.12.  DBMS and Database Considerations

   For many applications, such as databases, storing UUIDs as text is
   unnecessarily verbose, requiring 288 bits to represent 128 bit UUID
   values.  Thus, where feasible, UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database
   applications as the underlying 128 bit binary value.

   For other systems, UUIDs MAY be stored in binary form or as text, as
   appropriate.  The trade-offs to both approaches are:

   *  Storing as binary requires less space and may result in faster
      data access.

   *  Storing as text requires more space but may require less
      translation if the resulting text form is to be used after
      retrieval and thus maybe simpler to implement.

   DBMS vendors are encouraged to provide functionality to generate and
   store UUID formats defined by this specification for use as
   identifiers or left parts of identifiers such as, but not limited to,
   primary keys, surrogate keys for temporal databases, foreign keys
   included in polymorphic relationships, and keys for key-value pairs
   in JSON columns and key-value databases.  Applications using a
   monolithic database may find using database-generated UUIDs (as
   opposed to client-generate UUIDs) provides the best UUID
   monotonicity.  In addition to UUIDs, additional identifiers MAY be
   used to ensure integrity and feedback.

7.  IANA Considerations

   Per [RFC8141] here is the Namespace Registration Template filled out
   for this namespace and hereby a request to reference this document
   (when the final version is published) at [URNNamespaces].  Note that
   namespace is already listed and this is a request to update that
   entry to reference this document.

   Namespace Identifier: UUID (formal)

   Version: 1

   Date: 2003-10-01

   Registrant: JTC 1/SC6 (ASN.1 Rapporteur Group)

   Purpose: A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and
   time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  Since a UUID is a
   fixed size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to
   rollover (around A.D. 3400, depending on the specific algorithm
   used).  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging
   objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying
   very persistent objects across a network.

   Syntax: The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence
   of bits in memory, as described in Section 4 and Section 5.  To
   accurately represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the
   bit sequence to a string representation.

   The formal definition of the UUID string representation is provided
   by the following ABNF and definitions within Section 4 and more
   specifically Figure 4.

   Assignment: Individual UUID values are generated based on the
   uniqueness properties otherwise covered in this document with
   version-specific considerations for each.  Mechanisms include
   pseudorandom number generation, cryptographic hashing and the option
   to use IEEE 802 MAC addresses.

   Security and Privacy: The recommended generation algorithms for UUIDs
   per this document involve pseudorandom number generation and as such
   do not present additional privacy or data exposure risks beyond any
   such random value generated.  The use of IEEE 802 MAC addresses which
   may present security problems has explicitly been made optional and
   not recommended.

   Interoperability: UUIDs, and UUID values in the form of URNs in
   particular, are opaque values the syntax as covered above has no
   proposed changes and thus no known interoperability issues.

   Resolution: Since UUIDs are not globally resolvable, this is not
   applicable.

   Documentation: This document and RFC4122.  Relevant ancillary
   documentation: [NCA][C309]

   Additional Information: The intention here is simply to include this
   document in any applicable references at [URNNamespaces].  There is
   no intention to change the existing UUID URN registration.  The scope
   of this document pertains solely to the internal structure and
   versions of UUIDs, the textual format and URN registration are
   specifically out of scope and not changing as part of this update.

   Further, the authors and working group have decided that IANA is not
   required to track UUIDs used for identifying items such as namespaces
   or hashspaces from Appendix A and Appendix B.

8.  Community Considerations

   The use of UUIDs is extremely pervasive in computing.  They comprise
   the core identifier infrastructure for many operating systems such as
   Microsoft Windows and applications such as the Mozilla Web browser
   and in many cases, become exposed in many non-standard ways.

   This specification attempts to standardize that practice as openly as
   possible and in a way that attempts to benefit the entire Internet.

9.  Security Considerations

   Implementations MUST NOT assume that UUIDs are hard to guess.  Foe
   example, they MUST not be used as security capabilities (identifiers
   whose mere possession grants access).  Discovery of predictablity in
   a random number source will result in a vulnerability.

   Implementations MUST NOT assume that it is easy to determine if a
   UUID has been slightly transposed in order to redirect a reference to
   another object.  Humans do not have the ability to easily check the
   integrity of a UUID by simply glancing at it.

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and SHOULD not be used
   within a UUID.  Instead CSPRNG data SHOULD be selected from a source
   with sufficient entropy to ensure guaranteed uniqueness among UUID
   generation.  See Section 6.8 and Section 6.9 for more information.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with an embedded counter does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and its corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then UUIDv4,
   Section 5.4 SHOULD be utilized.

   See [RFC6151] for MD5 Security Considerations and [RFC6194] for SHA1
   security considerations.
