          A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace
                  draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
   UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally
   Unique IDentifier).  A UUID is 128 bits long, and can guarantee
   uniqueness across space and time.  UUIDs were originally used in the
   Apollo Network Computing System and later in the Open Software
   Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), and then
   in Microsoft Windows platforms.

   This specification is derived from the DCE specification with the
   kind permission of the OSF (now known as The Open Group).
   Information from earlier versions of the DCE specification have been
   incorporated into this document.

1.  Introduction

   This specification defines a Uniform Resource Name namespace for
   UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally
   Unique IDentifier).  A UUID is 128 bits long, and requires no central
   registration process.

   The information here is meant to be a concise guide for those wishing
   to implement services using UUIDs as URNs [RFC8141].  Nothing in this
   document should be construed to override the DCE standards that
   defined UUIDs.

   There is an ITU-T Recommendation and ISO/IEC Standard [X667] that are
   derived from earlier versions of this document.  Both sets of
   specifications have been aligned, and are fully technically
   compatible.  In addition, a global registration function is being
   provided by the Telecommunications Standardization Bureau of ITU-T;
   for details see https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/asn1/Pages/UUID/
   uuids.aspx.

2.  Motivation

   One of the main reasons for using UUIDs is that no centralized
   authority is required to administer them (although one format uses
   IEEE 802 node identifiers, others do not).  As a result, generation
   on demand can be completely automated, and used for a variety of
   purposes.  The UUID generation algorithm described here supports very
   high allocation rates of up to 10 million per second per machine if
   necessary, so that they could even be used as transaction IDs.

   UUIDs are of a fixed size (128 bits) which is reasonably small
   compared to other alternatives.  This lends itself well to sorting,
   ordering, and hashing of all sorts, storing in databases, simple
   allocation, and ease of programming in general.

   Since UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform
   Resource Names.  The unique ability to generate a new UUID without a
   registration process allows for UUIDs to be one of the URNs with the
   lowest minting cost.

   Furthermore, many things have changed in the time since UUIDs were
   originally created.  Modern applications have a need to create and
   utilize UUIDs as the primary identifier for a variety of different
   items in complex computational systems, including but not limited to
   database keys, file names, machine or system names, and identifiers
   for event-driven transactions.

   One area UUIDs have gained popularity is as database keys.  This
   stems from the increasingly distributed nature of modern
   applications.  In such cases, "auto increment" schemes often used by
   databases do not work well, as the effort required to coordinate
   unique numeric identifiers across a network can easily become a
   burden.  The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique, reasonably
   short values in distributed systems without requiring synchronization
   makes them a good alternative, but UUID versions 1-5 lack certain
   other desirable characteristics:

   1.  Non-time-ordered UUID versions such as UUIDv4 have poor database
       index locality.  Meaning new values created in succession are not
       close to each other in the index and thus require inserts to be
       performed at random locations.  The negative performance effects
       of which on common structures used for this (B-tree and its
       variants) can be dramatic.

   2.  The 100-nanosecond, Gregorian epoch used in UUIDv1 timestamps is
       uncommon and difficult to represent accurately using a standard
       number format such as [IEEE754].

   3.  Introspection/parsing is required to order by time sequence; as
       opposed to being able to perform a simple byte-by-byte
       comparison.

   4.  Privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
       address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC
       addresses can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and
       reveal various other information about such machines (minimally
       manufacturer, potentially other details).  Additionally, with the
       advent of virtual machines and containers, MAC address uniqueness
       is no longer guaranteed.

   5.  Many of the implementation details specified in RFC4122 involved
       trade offs that are neither possible to specify for all
       applications nor necessary to produce interoperable
       implementations.

   6.  RFC4122 did not distinguish between the requirements for
       generation of a UUID versus an application which simply stores
       one, which are often different.

   Due to the aforementioned issue, many widely distributed database
   applications and large application vendors have sought to solve the
   problem of creating a better time-based, sortable unique identifier
   for use as a database key.  This has lead to numerous implementations
   over the past 10+ years solving the same problem in slightly
   different ways.

   While preparing this specification the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

   An inspection of these implementations and the issues described above
   has led to this document which attempts to adapt UUIDs to address
   these issues.

4.  UUID Format

   The UUID format is 16 octets (128 bits); the variant bits in
   conjunction with the version bits described in the next sections in
   determine finer structure.

   UUIDs MAY be represented as binary data or integers.  When in use
   with URNs or applications, any given 128 bit UUID SHOULD be
   represented by the "hex-and-dash" string format consisting of
   multiple groups of upper or lowercase alphanumeric hex characters
   separated by a single dash/hyphen.  When used with databases please
   refer to Section 6.12.

   The formal definition of the UUID string representation is provided
   by the following (ABNF) [RFC4234].

      UUID                   = 4hexOctet "-"
                               2hexOctet "-"
                               2hexOctet "-"
                               2hexOctet "-"
                               6hexOctet
      hexOctet               = hexDigit hexDigit
      hexDigit =
            "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
            "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" /
            "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   An example UUID using this textual representation from the previous
   table observed in Figure 1.  Note that in this example the alphabetic
   characters may be all uppercase, all lowercase or mixe case as per
   [RFC4234], Section 2.3

4.1.  Variant Field

   The variant field determines the layout of the UUID.  That is, the
   interpretation of all other bits in the UUID depends on the setting
   of the bits in the variant field.  As such, it could more accurately
   be called a type field; we retain the original term for
   compatibility.  The variant field consists of a variable number of
   the most significant bits of octet 8 of the UUID.

   Table 1 lists the contents of the variant field, where the letter "x"
   indicates a "don't-care" value.

   Interoperability, in any form, with variants other than the one
   defined here is not guaranteed, and is not likely to be an issue in
   practice.

   Specifically for UUIDs in this document bits 64 and 65 of octet 8
   MUST be set to 1 and 0 as per row 2 of Table 1.  As such all bit and
   field layouts will detail a 2 bit variant entry as guidance.

4.2.  Version Field

   The version number is in the most significant 4 bits of octet 6.
   More specifically bits 48 through 51.  The remaining 4 bits of Octet
   6 are dynamic.

   Table 2 lists all of the versions for this UUID variant specified in
   this document.

5.  UUID Layouts

   To minimize confusion about bit assignments within octets and among
   differing versions, the UUID record definition is defined only in
   terms of fields that are integral numbers of octets.  The fields are
   presented with the most significant one first.

   In the absence of explicit application or presentation protocol
   specification to the contrary, each field is encoded with the Most
   Significant Byte first (known as network byte order).

   Note that in some instances the field names, particularly for
   multiplexed fields, follow historical practice.

   While discussing UUID field layouts, bit definitions start at 0 and
   end at 127 while octets definitions start at 0 and end at 15.

5.1.  UUID Version 1

   UUID Version 1 is a time-based UUID featuring a 60-bit timestamp
   represented by Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) as a count of 100-
   nanosecond intervals since 00:00:00.00, 15 October 1582 (the date of
   Gregorian reform to the Christian calendar).

   UUID Version 1 also features clock sequence field which is used to
   help avoid duplicates that could arise when the clock is set
   backwards in time or if the node ID changes.

   Finally the node field consists of an IEEE 802 MAC address, usually
   the host address.  For systems with multiple IEEE 802 addresses, any
   available one can be used.  The lowest addressed octet (octet number
   10) contains the global/local bit and the unicast/multicast bit, and
   is the first octet of the address transmitted on an 802.3 LAN.

   time_low:
      The least significant 32 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3)

   time_mid:
      The middle 16 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 32 through 47 (octets 4-5)

   time_hi_and_version:
      The first four most significant bits MUST contain the UUIDv1
      version (0001) while the remaining 12 bits will contain the most
      significant 12 bits from the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   clock_seq_hi_and_res:
      The first two bits MUST be set to the UUID variant (10) The
      remaining 6 bits contain the high portion of the clock sequence.
      Occupies bits 64 through 71 (octet 8) for a full 8 bits.

   clock_seq_low:
      The 8 bit low portion of the clock sequence.  Occupies bits 72
      through 79 (octet 9)

   node:
      48 bit spatially unique identifier Occupies bits 80 through 127
      (octets 10-15)

   For systems that do not have UTC available, but do have the local
   time, they may use that instead of UTC, as long as they do so
   consistently throughout the system.  However, this is not recommended
   since generating the UTC from local time only needs a time zone
   offset.

   If the clock is set backwards, or might have been set backwards
   (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the UUID generator can
   not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than
   the value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence has to
   be changed.  If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it
   can just be incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or
   high-quality pseudo-random value.

   Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g., because a network card has
   been moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random
   number minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight
   differences in the clock settings of the machines.  If the value of
   clock sequence associated with the changed node ID were known, then
   the clock sequence could just be incremented, but that is unlikely.

   The clock sequence MUST be originally (i.e., once in the lifetime of
   a system) initialized to a random number to minimize the correlation
   across systems.  This provides maximum protection against node
   identifiers that may move or switch from system to system rapidly.
   The initial value MUST NOT be correlated to the node identifier.

   For systems with no IEEE address, a randomly or pseudo-randomly
   generated value may be used; see Section 6.8 and Section 6.9.

5.2.  UUID Version 2

   UUID Version 2 is known as DCE Security UUIDs [C309] and [C311].  As
   such the definition of these UUIDs are outside the scope of this
   specification.

5.3.  UUID Version 3

   UUID Version 3 is meant for generating UUIDs from "names" that are
   drawn from, and unique within, some "name space" as per Section 6.5.

   UUIDv3 values are created by computing an MD5 [RFC1321] hash over a
   given name space value concatenated with the desired name value after
   both have been converted to a canonical sequence of octets in network
   byte order.  This MD5 value is then uses to populate all 128 bits of
   the UUID layout.  The UUID version and variant then replace the
   respective bits as defined by Section 4.2 and Section 4.1.

   Some common name space values have been defined via Appendix B.2.

   Where possible UUIDv5 SHOULD be used in lieu of UUIDv3.  For more
   information on MD5 security considerations see [RFC6151].

5.4.  UUID Version 4

   The version 4 UUID is meant for generating UUIDs from truly-random or
   pseudo-random numbers.

   An implementation may generate 128 bits of random random data which
   is used to fill out the UUID fields in Figure 8.  The UUID version
   and variant then replace the respective bits as defined by
   Section 4.2 and Section 4.1,

   Alternatively, an implementation MAY choose to randomly generate the
   exact required number of bits for for random_a, random_b, and
   random_c then concatenate the version and variant in the required
   position.

   For guidelines on random data generation see Section 6.8.

      field to be filled with random data as per Section 6.8

5.5.  UUID Version 5

   UUID Version 5 is meant for generating UUIDs from "names" that are
   drawn from, and unique within, some "name space" as per Section 6.5.

   UUIDv5 values are created by computing an SHA1 [SHA1] hash over a
   given name space value concatenated with the desired name value after
   both have been converted to a canonical sequence of octets in network
   byte order.  This SHA1 value is then uses to populate all 128 bits of
   the UUID layout.  Excess bits beyond 128 are discarded.  The UUID
   version and variant then replace the respective bits as defined by
   Section 4.2 and Section 4.1

   Some common name space values have been defined via Appendix B.2.

   For more information on MD5 security considerations see [RFC6194].

      significant, left-most bits.  Any leftover SHA1 bits are discarded
      and unused.

5.6.  UUID Version 6

   UUID version 6 is a field-compatible version of UUIDv1, reordered for
   improved DB locality.  It is expected that UUIDv6 will primarily be
   used in contexts where there are existing v1 UUIDs.  Systems that do
   not involve legacy UUIDv1 SHOULD consider using UUIDv7 instead.

   Instead of splitting the timestamp into the low, mid and high
   sections from UUIDv1, UUIDv6 changes this sequence so timestamp bytes
   are stored from most to least significant.  That is, given a 60 bit
   timestamp value as specified for UUIDv1 in Section 5.1, for UUIDv6,
   the first 48 most significant bits are stored first, followed by the
   4 bit version (same position), followed by the remaining 12 bits of
   the original 60 bit timestamp.

   The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from their usage and
   position in Section 5.1.

   The 48 bit node SHOULD be set to a pseudo-random value however
   implementations MAY choose to retain the old MAC address behavior
   from Section 5.1 and Section 6.9.  For more information on MAC
   address usage within UUIDs see the Section 9

   The format for the 16-byte, 128 bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 10

   time_high:
      The most significant 32 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.
      Occupies bits 0 through 31 (octets 0-3)

   time_mid:
      The middle 16 bits of the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 32 through 47 (octets 4-5)

   time_low_and_version:
      The first four most significant bits MUST contain the UUIDv6
      version (0110) while the remaining 12 bits will contain the least
      significant 12 bits from the 60 bit starting timestamp.  Occupies
      bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   clk_seq_hi_res:
      The first two bits MUST be set to the UUID variant (10) The
      remaining 6 bits contain the high portion of the clock sequence.
      Occupies bits 64 through 71 (octet 8) for a full 8 bits.

   clock_seq_low:
      The 8 bit low portion of the clock sequence.  Occupies bits 72
      through 79 (octet 9)

   node:
      48 bit spatially unique identifier Occupies bits 80 through 127
      (octets 10-15)

   With UUIDv6 the steps for splitting the timestamp into time_high and
   time_mid are OPTIONAL since the 48 bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order.  An extra step of splitting the first
   48 bits of the timestamp into the most significant 32 bits and least
   significant 16 bits proves useful when reusing an existing UUIDv1
   implementation.

5.7.  UUID Version 7

   UUID version 7 features a time-ordered value field derived from the
   widely implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source, the
   number of milliseconds seconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970 UTC, leap
   seconds excluded.  As well as improved entropy characteristics over
   versions 1 or 6.

   Implementations SHOULD utilize UUID version 7 over UUID version 1 and
   6 if possible.

      The 2 bit variant defined by Section 4.1.

   rand_b:
      The final 62 bits of pseudo-random data to provide uniqueness as
      per Section 6.2 and Section 6.8.

5.8.  UUID Version 8

   UUID version 8 provides an RFC-compatible format for experimental or
   vendor-specific use cases.  The only requirement is that the variant
   and version bits MUST be set as defined in Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2.  UUIDv8's uniqueness will be implementation-specific and
   SHOULD NOT be assumed.

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific time-based UUIDs.  To be clear:
   UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
   filled with random data.

   Some example situations in which UUIDv8 usage could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the use of one of the current UUIDs.

6.  UUID Best Practices

   The minimum requirements for generating UUIDs are described in this
   document for each version.  Everything else is an implementation
   detail and up to the implementer to decide what is appropriate for a
   given implementation.  That being said, various relevant factors are
   covered below to help guide an implementer through the different
   trade-offs among differing UUID implementations.

6.1.  Timestamp Granularity

   UUID timestamp source, precision and length was the topic of great
   debate while creating UUIDv7 for this specification.  As such
   choosing the right timestamp for your application is a very important
   topic.  This section will detail some of the most common points on
   this topic.

   Reliability:
      Implementations SHOULD use the current timestamp from a reliable
      source to provide values that are time-ordered and continually
      increasing.  Care SHOULD be taken to ensure that timestamp changes
      from the environment or operating system are handled in a way that
      is consistent with implementation requirements.  For example, if
      it is possible for the system clock to move backward due to either
      manual adjustment or corrections from a time synchronization
      protocol, implementations need to determine how to handle such
      cases.  (See Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing bullet below.)

   Source:
      UUID version 1 and 6 both utilize a Gregorian epoch timestamp
      while UUIDv7 utilizes a Unix Epoch timestamp.  If other timestamp
      sources or a custom timestamp epoch are required UUIDv8 SHOULD be
      leveraged.

   Sub-second Precision and Accuracy:
      Many levels of precision exist for timestamps: milliseconds,
      microseconds, nanoseconds, and beyond.  Additionally fractional
      representations of sub-second precision may be desired to mix
      various levels of precision in a time-ordered manner.
      Furthermore, system clocks themselves have an underlying
      granularity and it is frequently less than the precision offered
      by the operating system.  With UUID version 1 and 6,
      100-nanoseconds of precision are present while UUIDv7 features
      fixed millisecond level of precision within the Unix epoch that
      does not exceed the granularity capable in most modern systems.
      For other levels of precision UUIDv8 SHOULD be utilized.  Similar
      to Section 6.2, with UUIDv1 or UUIDv6, a high resolution timestamp
      can be simulated by keeping a count of the number of UUIDs that
      have been generated with the same value of the system time, and
      using it to construct the low order bits of the timestamp.  The
      count will range between zero and the number of 100-nanosecond
      intervals per system time interval.

   Length:
      The length of a given timestamp directly impacts how long a given
      UUID will be valid.  That is, how many timestamp ticks can be
      contained in a UUID before the maximum value for the timestamp
      field is reached.  Care should be given to ensure that the proper
      length is selected for a given timestamp.  UUID version 1 and 6
      utilize a 60 bit timestamp and UUIDv7 features a 48 bit timestamp.

   Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing:
      Implementations MAY alter the actual timestamp.  Some examples
      included security considerations around providing a real clock
      value within a UUID, to correct inaccurate clocks or to handle
      leap seconds.  This specification makes no requirement or
      guarantee about how close the clock value needs to be to actual
      time.  If UUIDs do not need to be frequently generated, the UUIDv1
      or UUIDv6 timestamp can simply be the system time multiplied by
      the number of 100-nanosecond intervals per system time interval.

   Padding:
      When timestamp padding is required, implementations MUST pad the
      most significant bits (left-most) bits with zeros.  An example is
      padding the most significant, left-most bits of a 32 bit Unix
      timestamp with zero's to fill out the 48 bit timestamp in UUIDv7.

   Truncating:
      Similarly, when timestamps need to be truncated: the lower, least
      significant bits MUST be used.  An example would be truncating a
      64 bit Unix timestamp to the least significant, right-most 48 bits
      for UUIDv7.

   Error Handling:
      If a system overruns the generator by requesting too many UUIDs
      within a single system time interval, the UUID service MUST either
      return an error, or stall the UUID generator until the system
      clock catches up.  Note that if the processors overrun the UUID
      generation frequently, additional node identifiers can be
      allocated to the system, which will permit higher speed allocation
      by making multiple UUIDs potentially available for each time stamp
      value.  Similar to Section 6.4 techniques

6.2.  Monotonicity and Counters

   Monotonicity is the backbone of time-based sortable UUIDs.  Naturally
   time-based UUIDs from this document will be monotonic due to an
   embedded timestamp however implementations can guarantee additional
   monotonicity via the concepts covered in this section.

   Additionally, care SHOULD be taken to ensure UUIDs generated in
   batches are also monotonic.  That is, if one-thousand UUIDs are
   generated for the same timestamp; there is sufficient logic for
   organizing the creation order of those one-thousand UUIDs.  For batch
   UUID creation implementations MAY utilize a monotonic counter which
   SHOULD increment for each UUID created during a given timestamp.

   For single-node UUID implementations that do not need to create
   batches of UUIDs, the embedded timestamp within UUID version 1, 6,
   and 7 can provide sufficient monotonicity guarantees by simply
   ensuring that timestamp increments before creating a new UUID.  For
   the topic of Distributed Nodes please refer to Section 6.4

   Implementations SHOULD choose one method for single-node UUID
   implementations that require batch UUID creation.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Bits (Method 1):
      This references the practice of allocating a specific number of
      bits in the UUID layout to the sole purpose of tallying the total
      number of UUIDs created during a given UUID timestamp tick.
      Positioning of a fixed bit-length counter SHOULD be immediately
      after the embedded timestamp.  This promotes sortability and
      allows random data generation for each counter increment.  With
      this method rand_a section of UUIDv7 SHOULD be utilized as fixed-
      length dedicated counter bits that are incremented by one for
      every UUID generation.  The trailing random bits generated for
      each new UUID in rand_b can help produce unguessable UUIDs.  In
      the event more counter bits are required the most significant,
      left-most, bits of rand_b MAY be leveraged as additional counter
      bits.

   Monotonic Random (Method 2):
      With this method the random data is extended to also double as a
      counter.  This monotonic random can be thought of as a "randomly
      seeded counter" which MUST be incremented in the least significant
      position for each UUID created on a given timestamp tick.
      UUIDv7's rand_b section SHOULD be utilized with this method to
      handle batch UUID generation during a single timestamp tick.  The
      increment value for every UUID generation SHOULD be a random
      integer of any desired length larger than zero.  It ensures the
      UUIDs retain the required level of unguessability characters
      provided by the underlying entropy.  The increment value MAY be
      one when the amount of UUIDs generated in a particular period of
      time is important and guessability is not an issue.  However, it
      SHOULD NOT be used by implementations that favor unguessiblity, as
      the resulting values are easily guessable.

   The following sub-topics cover topics related solely with creating
   reliable fixed-length dedicated counters:

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding:
      Implementations utilizing fixed-length counter method SHOULD
      randomly initialize the counter with each new timestamp tick.
      However, when the timestamp has not incremented; the counter
      SHOULD be frozen and incremented via the desired increment logic.
      When utilizing a randomly seeded counter alongside Method 1; the
      random MAY be regenerated with each counter increment without
      impacting sortability.  The downside is that Method 1 is prone to
      overflows if a counter of adequate length is not selected or the
      random data generated leaves little room for the required number
      of increments.  Implementations utilizing fixed-length counter
      method MAY also choose to randomly initialize a portion counter
      rather than the entire counter.  For example, a 24 bit counter
      could have the 23 bits in least-significant, right-most, position
      randomly initialized.  The remaining most significant, left-most
      counter bits are initialized as zero for the sole purpose of
      guarding against counter rollovers.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Length:
      Care MUST be taken to select a counter bit-length that can
      properly handle the level of timestamp precision in use.  For
      example, millisecond precision SHOULD require a larger counter
      than a timestamp with nanosecond precision.  General guidance is
      that the counter SHOULD be at least 12 bits but no longer than 42
      bits.  Care SHOULD also be given to ensure that the counter length
      selected leaves room for sufficient entropy in the random portion
      of the UUID after the counter.  This entropy helps improve the
      unguessability characteristics of UUIDs created within the batch.

   The following sub-topics cover rollover handling with either type of
   counter method:

   Counter Rollover Guards:
      The technique from Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding which
      describes allocating a segment of the fixed-length counter as a
      rollover guard is also helpful to mitigate counter rollover
      issues.  This same technique can be leveraged with Monotonic
      random counter methods by ensuring the total length of a possible
      increment in the least significant, right most position is less
      than the total length of the random being incremented.  As such
      the most significant, left-most, bits can be incremented as
      rollover guarding.

   Counter Rollover Handling:
      Counter rollovers SHOULD be handled by the application to avoid
      sorting issues.  The general guidance is that applications that
      care about absolute monotonicity and sortability SHOULD freeze the
      counter and wait for the timestamp to advance which ensures
      monotonicity is not broken.  Alternatively, implementations MAY
      increment the timestamp ahead of the actual time and reinitialize
      the counter.

   Implementations MAY use the following logic to ensure UUIDs featuring
   embedded counters are monotonic in nature:

   1.  Compare the current timestamp against the previously stored
       timestamp.

   2.  If the current timestamp is equal to the previous timestamp;
       increment the counter according to the desired method.

   3.  If the current timestamp is greater than the previous timestamp;
       re-initialize the desired counter method to the new timestamp and
       generate new random bytes (if the bytes were frozen or being used
       as the seed for a monotonic counter).

   Implementations SHOULD check if the the currently generated UUID is
   greater than the previously generated UUID.  If this is not the case
   then any number of things could have occurred.  Such as, but not
   limited to, clock rollbacks, leap second handling or counter
   rollovers.  Applications SHOULD embed sufficient logic to catch these
   scenarios and correct the problem ensuring the next UUID generated is
   greater than the previous.  To handle this scenario, the general
   guidance is that application MAY reuse the previous timestamp and
   increment the previous counter method.

6.3.  UUID Generator States

   The UUID Generator state only needs to be read from stable storage
   once at boot time, if it is read into a system-wide shared volatile
   store (and updated whenever the stable store is updated).

   If an implementation does not have any stable store available, then
   it can always say that the values were unavailable.  This is the
   least desirable implementation because it will increase the frequency
   of creation of values such as clock sequence, counters or random data
   which increases the probability of duplicates.

   For UUIDv1 and UUIDv6, if the node ID can never change (e.g., the net
   card is inseparable from the system), or if any change also
   reinitializes the clock sequence to a random value, then instead of
   keeping it in stable store, the current node ID may be returned

   For UUIDv1 and UUIDv6, the state does not always need to be written
   to stable store every time a UUID is generated.  The timestamp in the
   stable store can be periodically set to a value larger than any yet
   used in a UUID.  As long as the generated UUIDs have timestamps less
   than that value, and the clock sequence and node ID remain unchanged,
   only the shared volatile copy of the state needs to be updated.
   Furthermore, if the timestamp value in stable store is in the future
   by less than the typical time it takes the system to reboot, a crash
   will not cause a reinitialization of the clock sequence.

   If it is too expensive to access shared state each time a UUID is
   generated, then the system-wide generator can be implemented to
   allocate a block of time stamps each time it is called; a per-
   process generator can allocate from that block until it is exhausted.

6.4.  Distributed UUID Generation

   Some implementations MAY desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve two or more nodes independently generating
   UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  While UUIDs already
   feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of collision
   are low as the total number of nodes increase; so does the likelihood
   of a collision.

   This section will detail the approaches that have been observed by by
   multi-node UUID implementations in distributed environments.

   Centralized Registry:
      With this method all nodes tasked with creating UUIDs consult a
      central registry and confirm the generated value is unique.  As
      applications scale the communication with the central registry
      could become a bottleneck and impact UUID generation in a negative
      way.  Utilization of shared knowledge schemes with central/global
      registries is outside the scope of this specification and should
      generally be discouraged.

   Node IDs:
      With this method, a pseudo-random Node ID value is placed within
      the UUID layout.  This identifier helps ensure the bit-space for a
      given node is unique, resulting in UUIDs that do not conflict with
      any other UUID created by another node with a different node id.
      Implementations that choose to leverage an embedded node id SHOULD
      utilize UUIDv8.  The node id SHOULD NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address
      as per Section 9.  The location and bit length are left to
      implementations and are outside the scope of this specification.
      Furthermore, the creation and negotiation of unique node ids among
      nodes is also out of scope for this specification.

   Utilization of either a Centralized Registry or Node ID are not
   required for implementing UUIDs in this specification.  However
   implementations SHOULD utilize one of the two aforementioned methods
   if distributed UUID generation is a requirement.

6.5.  Name-Based UUID Generation

   TODO, define how to compute a namespace ID if I don't want to use one
   from Appendix B.2

   The concept of name and name space should be broadly construed, and
   not limited to textual names.  For example, some name spaces are the
   domain name system, URLs, Object Identifiers (OIDs), X.500
   Distinguished Names (DNs), and reserved words in a programming
   language.  The mechanisms or conventions used for allocating names
   and ensuring their uniqueness within their name spaces are beyond the
   scope of this specification.

   The requirements for these types of UUIDs are as follows:

   *  The UUIDs generated at different times from the same name in the
      same namespace MUST be equal.

   *  The UUIDs generated from two different names in the same namespace
      should be different (with very high probability).

   *  The UUIDs generated from the same name in two different namespaces
      should be different (with very high probability).

   *  If two UUIDs that were generated from names are equal, then they
      were generated from the same name in the same namespace (with very
      high probability).

6.6.  Collision Resistance

   Implementations SHOULD weigh the consequences of UUID collisions
   within their application and when deciding between UUID versions that
   use entropy (random) versus the other components such as Section 6.1
   and Section 6.2.  This is especially true for distributed node
   collision resistance as defined by Section 6.4.

   There are two example scenarios below which help illustrate the
   varying seriousness of a collision within an application.

   Low Impact
      A UUID collision generated a duplicate log entry which results in
      incorrect statistics derived from the data.  Implementations that
      are not negatively affected by collisions may continue with the
      entropy and uniqueness provided by the traditional UUID format.

   High Impact:
      A duplicate key causes an airplane to receive the wrong course
      which puts people's lives at risk.  In this scenario there is no
      margin for error.  Collisions MUST be avoided and failure is
      unacceptable.  Applications dealing with this type of scenario
      MUST employ as much collision resistance as possible within the
      given application context.

6.7.  Global and Local Uniqueness

   UUIDs created by this specification MAY be used to provide local
   uniqueness guarantees.  For example, ensuring UUIDs created within a
   local application context are unique within a database MAY be
   sufficient for some implementations where global uniqueness outside
   of the application context, in other applications, or around the
   world is not required.

   Although true global uniqueness is impossible to guarantee without a
   shared knowledge scheme; a shared knowledge scheme is not required by
   UUID to provide uniqueness guarantees.  Implementations MAY implement
   a shared knowledge scheme introduced in Section 6.4 as they see fit
   to extend the uniqueness guaranteed this specification.

6.8.  Unguessability

   TODO: Here or in security considerations, discuss security
   considerations with with "running out of random"

   Implementations SHOULD utilize a cryptographically secure pseudo-
   random number generator (CSPRNG) to provide values that are both
   difficult to predict ("unguessable") and have a low likelihood of
   collision ("unique").  Care SHOULD be taken to ensure the CSPRNG
   state is properly reseeded upon state changes, such as process forks,
   to ensure proper CSPRNG operation.  CSPRNG ensures the best of
   Section 6.6 and Section 9 are present in modern UUIDs.

   Further advice on generating cryptographic-quality random numbers can
   be found in [RFC4086]

6.9.  UUIDs that Do Not Identify the Host

   This section describes how to generate a UUIDv1 or UUIDv6 value if an
   IEEE 802 address is not available, or its use is not desired.

   One approach is to contact the IEEE and get a separate block of
   addresses.  At the time of writing, the application could be found at
   https://standards.ieee.org/products-programs/regauth/.

   A better solution is to obtain a 47-bit cryptographic quality random
   number and use it as the low 47 bits of the node ID, with the least
   significant bit of the first octet of the node ID set to one.  This
   bit is the unicast/multicast bit, which will never be set in IEEE 802
   addresses obtained from network cards.  Hence, there can never be a
   conflict between UUIDs generated by machines with and without network
   cards.  (Recall that the IEEE 802 spec talks about transmission
   order, which is the opposite of the in-memory representation that is
   discussed in this document.)

   For compatibility with earlier specifications, note that this
   document uses the unicast/multicast bit, instead of the arguably more
   correct local/global bit.

   In addition, items such as the computer's name and the name of the
   operating system, while not strictly speaking random, will help
   differentiate the results from those obtained by other systems.

   The exact algorithm to generate a node ID using these data is system
   specific, because both the data available and the functions to obtain
   them are often very system specific.  A generic approach, however, is
   to accumulate as many sources as possible into a buffer, use a
   message digest such as MD5 [RFC1321] or SHA-1 [SHA1], take an
   arbitrary 6 bytes from the hash value, and set the multicast bit as
   described above.

6.10.  Sorting

   UUIDv6 and UUIDv7 are designed so that implementations that require
   sorting (e.g. database indexes) SHOULD sort as opaque raw bytes,
   without need for parsing or introspection.

   Time ordered monotonic UUIDs benefit from greater database index
   locality because the new values are near each other in the index.  As
   a result objects are more easily clustered together for better
   performance.  The real-world differences in this approach of index
   locality vs random data inserts can be quite large.

   UUIDs formats created by this specification SHOULD be
   Lexicographically sortable while in the textual representation.

   UUIDs created by this specification are crafted with big-ending byte
   order (network byte order) in mind.  If Little-endian style is
   required a custom UUID format SHOULD be created using UUIDv8.

6.11.  Opacity

   UUIDs SHOULD be treated as opaque values and implementations SHOULD
   NOT examine the bits in a UUID to whatever extent is possible.
   However, where necessary, inspectors should refer to Section 4.1 and
   Section 4.2 for more information on determining UUID version and
   variant.

6.12.  DBMS and Database Considerations

   For many applications, such as databases, storing UUIDs as text is
   unnecessarily verbose, requiring 288 bits to represent 128 bit UUID
   values.  Thus, where feasible, UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database
   applications as the underlying 128 bit binary value.

   For other systems, UUIDs MAY be stored in binary form or as text, as
   appropriate.  The trade-offs to both approaches are as such:

   *  Storing as binary requires less space and may result in faster
      data access.

   *  Storing as text requires more space but may require less
      translation if the resulting text form is to be used after
      retrieval and thus maybe simpler to implement.

   DBMS vendors are encouraged to provide functionality to generate and
   store UUID formats defined by this specification for use as
   identifiers or left parts of identifiers such as, but not limited to,
   primary keys, surrogate keys for temporal databases, foreign keys
   included in polymorphic relationships, and keys for key-value pairs
   in JSON columns and key-value databases.  Applications using a
   monolithic database may find using database-generated UUIDs (as
   opposed to client-generate UUIDs) provides the best UUID
   monotonicity.  In addition to UUIDs, additional identifiers MAY be
   used to ensure integrity and feedback.

7.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: Q: Should Namespace Registration Template be here or in
   Appendix A?  TODO: Need to ensure IANA doc,
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml,
   has this new document listed.

8.  Community Considerations

   The use of UUIDs is extremely pervasive in computing.  They comprise
   the core identifier infrastructure for many operating systems
   (Microsoft Windows) and applications (the Mozilla browser) and in
   many cases, become exposed to the Web in many non-standard ways.

   This specification attempts to standardize that practice as openly as
   possible and in a way that attempts to benefit the entire Internet.

9.  Security Considerations

   Do not assume that UUIDs are hard to guess; they should not be used
   as security capabilities (identifiers whose mere possession grants
   access), for example.  A predictable random number source will
   exacerbate the situation.

   Do not assume that it is easy to determine if a UUID has been
   slightly transposed in order to redirect a reference to another
   object.  Humans do not have the ability to easily check the integrity
   of a UUID by simply glancing at it.

   Distributed applications generating UUIDs at a variety of hosts must
   be willing to rely on the random number source at all hosts.  If this
   is not feasible, the namespace variant should be used.

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and SHOULD not be used
   within a UUID.  Instead CSPRNG data SHOULD be selected from a source
   with sufficient entropy to ensure guaranteed uniqueness among UUID
   generation.  See Section 6.8 for more information.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with an embedded counter does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and it's corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then UUIDv4,
   Section 5.4 SHOULD be utilized.

   See [RFC6151] for MD5 Security Considerations and [RFC6194] for SHA1
   security considerations.

Appendix A.  Namespace Registration Template

   TODO: Revise as per https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141#appendix-A
   and https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8141#section-6.2

   Namespace ID:
      UUID

   Registration Information:
      Registration date: 2003-10-01

   Declared registrant of the namespace:
      JTC 1/SC6 (ASN.1 Rapporteur Group)

   Declaration of syntactic structure:
      A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both space and time,
      with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  Since a UUID is a fixed
      size and contains a time field, it is possible for values to
      rollover (around A.D. 3400, depending on the specific algorithm
      used).  A UUID can be used for multiple purposes, from tagging
      objects with an extremely short lifetime, to reliably identifying
      very persistent objects across a network.

      The internal representation of a UUID is a specific sequence of
      bits in memory, as described in Section 4.  To accurately
      represent a UUID as a URN, it is necessary to convert the bit
      sequence to a string representation.

      Each field is treated as an integer and has its value printed as a
      zero-filled hexadecimal digit string with the most significant
      digit first.  The hexadecimal values "a" through "f" are output as
      lower case characters and are case insensitive on input.

      The formal definition of the UUID string representation is
      provided by the following ABNF [RFC4234]:

   UUID                   = time-low "-" time-mid "-"
                            time-high-and-version "-"
                            clock-seq-and-reserved
                            clock-seq-low "-" node
   time-low               = 4hexOctet
   time-mid               = 2hexOctet
   time-high-and-version  = 2hexOctet
   clock-seq-and-reserved = hexOctet
   clock-seq-low          = hexOctet
   node                   = 6hexOctet
   hexOctet               = hexDigit hexDigit
   hexDigit =
         "0" / "1" / "2" / "3" / "4" / "5" / "6" / "7" / "8" / "9" /
         "a" / "b" / "c" / "d" / "e" / "f" /
         "A" / "B" / "C" / "D" / "E" / "F"

   The following is an example of the string representation of a UUID as
   a URN:

   urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6

   Relevant ancillary documentation:  [NCA][C309]

   Identifier uniqueness considerations:  This document specifies three
      algorithms to generate UUIDs: the first leverages the unique
      values of 802 MAC addresses to guarantee uniqueness, the second
      uses pseudo-random number generators, and the third uses
      cryptographic hashing and application-provided text strings.  As a
      result, the UUIDs generated according to the mechanisms here will
      be unique from all other UUIDs that have been or will be assigned.

   Identifier persistence considerations:  UUIDs are inherently very
      difficult to resolve in a global sense.  This, coupled with the
      fact that UUIDs are temporally unique within their spatial
      context, ensures that UUIDs will remain as persistent as possible.

   Process of identifier assignment:  Generating a UUID does not require
      that a registration authority be contacted.  One algorithm
      requires a unique value over space for each generator.  This value
      is typically an IEEE 802 MAC address, usually already available on
      network-connected hosts.  The address can be assigned from an
      address block obtained from the IEEE registration authority.  If
      no such address is available, or privacy concerns make its use
      undesirable, Section 6.9 specifies two alternatives.  Another
      approach is to use version 3 or version 4 UUIDs as defined below.

   Process for identifier resolution:  Since UUIDs are not globally
      resolvable, this is not applicable.

   Rules for Lexical Equivalence:  Consider each field of the UUID to be
      an unsigned integer as shown in the tables in section Section 5.
      Then, to compare a pair of UUIDs, arithmetically compare the
      corresponding fields from each UUID in order of significance and
      according to their data type.  Two UUIDs are equal if and only if
      all the corresponding fields are equal.

      As an implementation note, equality comparison can be performed on
      many systems by doing the appropriate byte-order canonicalization,
      and then treating the two UUIDs as 128-bit unsigned integers.

      UUIDs, as defined in this document, can also be ordered
      lexicographically.  For a pair of UUIDs, the first one follows the
      second if the most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is
      greater for the first UUID.  The second follows the first if the
      most significant field in which the UUIDs differ is greater for
      the second UUID.

   Conformance with URN Syntax:  The string representation of a UUID is
      fully compatible with the URN syntax.  When converting from a bit-
      oriented, in-memory representation of a UUID into a URN, care must
      be taken to strictly adhere to the byte order issues mentioned in
      the string representation section.

   Validation mechanism:  Apart from determining whether the timestamp
      portion of the UUID is in the future and therefore not yet
      assignable, there is no mechanism for determining whether a UUID
      is 'valid'.

   Scope:  UUIDs are global in scope.

Appendix B.  Example Code

B.1.  Creating UUIDv1 through UUIDv5 Value

   This implementation consists of 5 files: uuid.h, uuid.c, sysdep.h,
   sysdep.c and utest.c.  The uuid.* files are the system independent
   implementation of the UUID generation algorithms described above,
   with all the optimizations described above except efficient state
   sharing across processes included.  The code has been tested on Linux
   (Red Hat 4.0) with GCC (2.7.2), and Windows NT 4.0 with VC++ 5.0.
   The code assumes 64-bit integer support, which makes it much clearer.

      encoded using the fractional representation

   *  58 bit random number

   *  8 bit application-specific unique node ID

   *  8 bit rolling sequence number

#include <stdint.h>

  // ...
}

int generate_uuidv8(uint8_t *uuid, uint8_t node_id) {

  uuid[4] = timestamp_subsec >> 8;
  uuid[5] = timestamp_subsec;

Appendix C.  Test Vectors

   Both UUIDv1 and UUIDv6 test vectors utilize the same 60 bit

   22, 2022 2:22:22.000000 PM GMT-05:00

   Both UUIDv1 and UUIDv6 utilize the same values in clk_seq_hi_res,

C.7.  Example of a UUIDv8 Value

   This example UUIDv8 test vector utilizes a well-known 64 bit Unix
   epoch with nanosecond precision, truncated to the least-significant,
   right-most, bits to fill the first 48 bits through version.

   The next two segments of custom_b and custom_c are are filled with
   random data.

   Timestamp is Tuesday, February 22, 2022 2:22:22.000000 PM GMT-05:00
   represented as 0x16D6320C3D4DCC00 or 1645557742000000000

   It should be noted that this example is just to illustrate one
   scenario for UUIDv8.  Test vectors will likely be implementation
   specific and vary greatly from this simple example.
